## Starting Project with template

Usage
Here's a simple example to get you started with Frontron:

### 1. Create a new Frontron project
You can create a new Frontron project using create-frontron. This tool allows you to scaffold a new project with various templates.

Compatibility Note:
Frontron requires Node.js version 20+. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.

With NPM:
```bash
$ npm create frontron@latest
```

With Yarn:
```bash
$ yarn create frontron
```

With PNPM:
```bash
$ pnpm create frontron
```

With Bun:
```bash
$ bun create frontron
```
Then follow the prompts!

You can also directly specify the project name and the template you want to use via additional command line options. For example, to scaffold a frontron project with React templates, run:

```bash
# npm 20+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create frontron@latest my-react-app -- --template react

# yarn
yarn create frontron my-react-app --template react

# pnpm
pnpm create frontron my-react-app --template react

# Bun
bun create frontron my-react-app --template react
```

Currently Supported Template Presets

- `react`
- `react-ts`
- `react-swc`
- `react-swc-ts`
- `next-page`
- `next-page-ts`
- `next-app`
- `next-app-ts`

You can use . for the project name to scaffold in the current directory.

### 2. Start the development server

```bash
npm run app
```
This command will start the development server with hot module replacement, making it easy to see your changes in real-time.

### 3. Build your application for production

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will bundle your application using Rollup and produce optimized static assets for production.
